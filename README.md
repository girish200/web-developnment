<p>STUDY FLEX SYSTEM(SFS):</p>
<p>Our unique Study Flex System at Saveetha gives the freedom to the students to choose their courses, faculty and timings. We believe in creating an independent, self-sufficient and a happy professional. The students are attached with a mentor who helps them to design their personalised course map and plan accordingly to complete the degree successfully. This will help the student to be more responsible and will have a clear idea of what he is studying in his 4 year of study. </p>
